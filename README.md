jquery-stalker
==============

Stalker is a cool jQuery transition effect plugin - when scrolled past, it attaches specified element to the top of
the screen. As you scroll past it becomes fixed, and when you scroll back beyond the element, it goes back to normal
positioning. See demo.html for an example.

Usage:
```html
  jQuery("#stalker").stalker();
```
